# Predict.fun Crypto Up/Down — Market Data

Tick-level market data for **Predict.fun** crypto Up/Down markets — the
prediction-market venue reachable from the Binance Wallet front end (BNB
chain) — collected 24/7 directly from the source feeds. This repository hosts
**free samples and documentation**; the full dataset is sold by subscription or
by range.

本仓库提供 **Predict.fun**（币安钱包前端接入的预测市场，BNB 链）加密 Up/Down
市场数据的**免费样例与文档**；完整数据集按订阅或按区间出售。

> This is a **separate venue** from Polymarket, with a different settlement

## What the full dataset contains / 完整数据集内容

| dataset | description |
|---|---|
| `prices` | The settlement price feed, tick-by-tick (~1Hz per symbol), with three timestamps and a `provider` column recording the channel we subscribe the feed on (see *Known limits*) |
| `orderbook` | Full order-book snapshots. Throttled to 1/sec per market through 2026-08-24; **unthrottled from 2026-08-25**, so every snapshot the venue pushed is archived — several times the detail |
| `markets` | Per-market metadata with **strike** (`start_price`) and **settlement price** (`end_price`) — every slot's outcome (Up / Down / push) is verifiable from this file alone |
| `klines` | 13 intraday periods (1s..1d) plus 3d / 1w / 1mo full-history snapshots, derived from the price ticks |

- Assets: BTC, ETH, BNB × intervals 5m / 15m / hourly / daily. The 5m and 15m
  markets settle on **Chainlink**; the hourly and 24h ones settle on **Binance**
  candles — `price_feed_provider` says which, per market
- History from 2026-06-12, growing daily. Note that **2026-06-12 is a partial
  day** (collection started mid-day; ~66% of the day's seconds) — the **first
  complete UTC day is 2026-06-13**. Early days also carry fewer ETH/BNB slots,
  which only had daily markets at the time.
- Every file ships with row counts + SHA-256 in the manifest, so you can verify
  what you received; the price files carry per-tick timestamps, so feed
  continuity is auditable directly from the data

## Samples / 样例

**[Download the sample bundle](https://github.com/Ligengxin96/predict.fun-data-samples/releases/latest/download/predict-fun-data-samples.tar.gz)**
— one real, unmodified UTC day (**2026-09-08**) of the BTC 5-minute series plus
the settlement price feed, the full market/settlement table and one kline period.

> **The data is in the Release, not in the git tree.** Clicking *Code → Download
> ZIP* gets you the documentation and nothing else. This is deliberate: a
> half-populated archive would replay without errors and give wrong answers, so
> the repository ships either the whole day or none of it.
>
> **数据在 Release 里，不在 git 仓库里。** 点 *Code → Download ZIP* 只会拿到文档。
> 这是有意的：残缺的归档跑起来不报错却会给出错误结果，所以要么给完整一天，要么不给。

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/Ligengxin96/predict.fun-data-samples/releases/latest/download/predict-fun-data-samples.tar.gz | tar xz
```

It unpacks to `predict-fun-data-samples/`, laid out exactly like the paid
archive, so it replays directly:

```bash
# The order book is unthrottled from 2026-08-25 — 478,603 full snapshots in this
# one day — so give the replay room. The default Node heap is not enough.
NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 ot run . --data ./predict-fun-data-samples
```

| file (inside the bundle) | rows | what |
|---|---|---|
| `data/predict-fun/prices/BTCUSDT/BTCUSDT-feed1-predict-prices-2026-09-08.csv.gz` | 82,342 | settlement price ticks |
| `data/predict-fun/orderbook/BTC-5M/BTC-5M-predict-orderbook-2026-09-08.jsonl.gz` | 478,603 | order-book snapshots, unthrottled |
| `data/predict-fun/markets/predict-markets-2026-09-08.jsonl.gz` | 1,245 | every market that day (all assets and intervals) with strike + settlement price |
| `data/predict-fun/klines/BTCUSDT/1m/BTCUSDT-feed1-1m-2026-09-08.csv.gz` | 1,440 | 1-minute klines (one of 13 periods in the full set) |

The order book has been unthrottled since 2026-08-25: this day carries 478,603
snapshots for BTC-5M, against 68,398 on a throttled day. The whole day was
collected after the `provider` fix went live (2026-09-05), so that column is
correct as captured, not corrected after the fact.

盘口自 2026-08-25 起不再限流：本样例日仅 BTC-5M 就有 478,603 条快照，而限流时期的
日子只有 68,398 条。整个样例日都是在 `provider` 修复上线（2026-09-05）之后采集的，
因此这一列是采集时就正确的，不是事后修正的。

Each file is also attached to the Release individually, for anyone who only
wants one of them. Row counts are data rows (CSV headers excluded); every file
carries its SHA-256 in [`samples/manifest.json`](samples/manifest.json). Those
checksums are the archive's own, so a sample verifies byte for byte against a
delivered bundle.

### Verify it yourself / 自行验证

The venue publishes each market's own `start_price` (the strike) and
`end_price` (the settlement price). What matters about our data is whether the
price stream we sell is the one those numbers came from — so that is what this
check asks: **does our archived tick at those exact seconds reproduce the
venue's published prices?**

On 2026-09-08, across the 291 BTC 5-minute markets in the sample:

| | count | result |
|---|---|---|
| boundary seconds we hold a tick for | 543 | **543 of 543 reproduce the venue's published price** |
| boundary seconds absent from our feed | 39 | not independently provable — reported as undetermined |

Prices are compared at the precision the venue itself printed. Our files carry
the full float64 expansion (`64944.024999999994`), the venue prints the same
number as `64944.025`; those are one value, not a disagreement.

Settlement is then plain arithmetic on the same file, with one wrinkle worth
knowing before you score anything: a slot that closes exactly where it opened is
**a push, not an Up win** — the venue resolves both sides as won and returns the
stakes. So `end_price > start_price` → Up, `end_price < start_price` → Down,
`end_price == start_price` → push. That day: **139 Up, 152 Down and no push**.
Pushes do happen: on 2026-08-25, `btc-updown-5m-1787649300` opened and closed at
`79844.005` and was resolved as one.

Ties are not a rounding curiosity: across our history roughly **1 in 100
five-minute slots** closes flat. Note this is the opposite of Polymarket, whose
rules settle a tie to Up — a binary `>=` predicate is wrong on this venue.

场方为每个市场发布自己的 `start_price`（strike）与 `end_price`（结算价）。对我们的
数据而言真正要紧的是：**我们卖的这条价格流，是不是它结算时用的那条**。所以这里核对的
是「我方在那两个精确秒归档的 tick，能否复现场方发布的价格」。

2026-09-08 当天样例中的 291 个 BTC 5 分钟局：我方持有边界秒 tick 的 **543 个，
543/543 全部与场方发布价一致**；另有 39 个边界秒不在我方 feed 中，按不可独立证明
处理、不作判定。比较按场方自己打印的精度进行——我方文件存的是 float64 的完整展开
（`64944.024999999994`），场方打印为 `64944.025`，二者是同一个数、不是分歧。

结算本身可直接在同一文件上算，但计分前有一处需要留意：收在起点价上的局是**平局
退款（push），不算 Up 赢**——场方会把两边都判为赢、本金退回。即
`end_price > start_price` → Up，`end_price < start_price` → Down，
`end_price == start_price` → push。当天为 **139 Up / 152 Down / 0 push**。
平局确实会出现：2026-08-25 的 `btc-updown-5m-1787649300` 开收都是 `79844.005`，
被判为 push。

平局并非可以忽略的边角：在我们的历史数据里，5 分钟局约**每 100 局就有 1 局**收在平局。
另请注意这与 Polymarket 相反——后者的规则把平局判给 Up，所以在本 venue 上用
`>=` 这种二元判据是错的。

## Data quality on the sample day / 样例当天的数据质量

- Settlement feed: **82,342 of the day's 86,400 seconds (95.3%)** carried a
  report, with **no gap longer than 9 seconds** across the whole 24 hours.
- Order book: 478,603 snapshots for BTC-5M alone, unthrottled.
- Capture latency for the order book, measured on this day:
  **p50 55 ms, p95 176 ms** (`recv_ms − update_ts_ms`).
- Collection point sits next to the venue's own infrastructure in Tokyo.

You can check the feed-continuity claim yourself: `publish_time` in the price
file is a unix second, so the gap distribution is computable straight from the
sample.

结算价流当天覆盖 86,400 秒中的 **82,342 秒（95.3%）**，**最大间隔 9 秒**；仅
BTC-5M 一个系列就有 478,603 条盘口快照（未限流）；盘口采集延迟当日实测
**p50 55 毫秒、p95 176 毫秒**（`recv_ms − update_ts_ms`）；采集点部署在东京，紧邻
场方基础设施。价格文件的 `publish_time` 是 unix 秒，间隔分布可直接从样例自行核算。

## Known limits — stated up front / 已知限制（先说清楚）

- Prices are **float64 only**. The upstream publishes no full-precision integer
  string for this venue, so none is archived.
- Order book is **snapshots only** — the upstream stream carries no deltas, and
  there is no trade tape. (Our Polymarket dataset does have both.)
- The `provider` column records the channel we subscribe a feed on, not an
  upstream per-tick source. **For data dated 2026-09-03 and earlier it is
  unreliable — ignore it** (it tracked whichever market our discovery loop saw
  last, and one feed is shared by markets declaring different settlement
  sources, so it flipped on our 10s poll; fixed 2026-09-05, and data from 2026-09-04 onward is correct). The price data
  itself was never affected: every tick arrives on one upstream topic and the
  feed carries no per-tick source information, so there is nothing to filter or
  group by here. See `DATA_GUIDE.md`.
- The price feed's upstream timestamps (`publish_time`, `server_ts`) are **whole
  seconds**, so a millisecond-level capture latency cannot be derived for it —
  the quantisation is larger than the latency being measured. `recv_ms` is our
  own millisecond receive time, and the order book does carry a millisecond
  upstream timestamp, which is why the latency figure above is quoted for the
  book only. We would rather omit a number than publish one its inputs cannot
  support.

价格仅 float64（上游无全精度串）；盘口**只有快照**，上游不发增量，也没有成交
流水（我们的 Polymarket 数据集两者都有）；`provider` 列记录的是我们订阅该 feed 所用的
通道，不是上游逐条给出的来源标注，**2026-09-03 及更早的数据里这一列不可靠、请忽略**
（当时它跟随我们的发现循环最后处理到的那个市场，而同一条 feed 被声明了不同结算源的
市场共用，于是随 10 秒轮询来回跳；已于 2026-09-05 修复，2026-09-04 起的数据是正确的）。**价格数据本身从未受影响**：每条 tick 都来自
同一个上游 topic，且该 feed 不携带任何逐条来源信息，无需按此列过滤或分组，详见说明书。
价格流的上游时间戳（`publish_time`、`server_ts`）**只到整秒**，因此无法据此给出
毫秒级采集延迟——量化误差比要测的延迟本身还大；`recv_ms` 是我方毫秒级接收时间，
而盘口带有毫秒级上游时间戳，所以上面的延迟数字只给盘口。**宁可不给一个数字，
也不给一个它的输入撑不起来的数字。**
历史起点 2026-06-12，但**该日为部分覆盖日**（当天中途开采，约占全天 66%），
**首个完整 UTC 日为 2026-06-13**；早期若干天 ETH/BNB 槽位较少（当时只有 daily 市场）。
